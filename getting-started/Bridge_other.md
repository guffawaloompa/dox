### Bridge on to Telos EVM from other chains
Ways to get other coins to the Telos EVM
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Option #1: Multichain" %}
you can use multichain.org to bridge USDC, USDT, ETH, WBTC, SUSHI, BNB, AVAX, MATIC, FTM, ONE, LINK, BUSD etc.  
(Note: Some coins may have relatively low liquidity on the Telos EVM currently, check them in advance)  
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Option #2: ElkNet" %}
you can use the Elknet bridge from elk.finance  
You basically buy ELK from any of the chains they support, bridge it to Telos, and then sell them here.  
Make sure to check there's enough liquidity if you are transferring huge amounts.  
***remember to swap ELK to gas to enable futher transaction***

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}


The same two bridges can be used to move those coins off the Telos EVM.
